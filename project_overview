The idea is a shiny app that would work well on mobile and it would simply allow you to select an activity you have performed, and for how long roughly it took.

It could include bleeps - number/location/how long spent dealing with it.
Patient reviews in ED
Patient reviews in A23
Trips to theatre
Obstetric tasks - reviews on LS or ABC
Procedures in labour ward theatre


If the review happened in ED instead of GTU, was this because of patient acuity or lack of staffing.

Then it would be able to output a total for a shift, so would need to deal with times and record shift start and end times, detailing how much time was spent doing what.

It is probably similar to fitness tracking apps, I could see if any of those exist for Shiny and take inspiraiton

But the basic function would be something like

***Record Activity***
header/box title


***Drop down box of activity options***
radio button select and also "not in this list"


***Time started***
use a slider or clock funciton or digital entry, need to deal with date and times


***Duration to nearest minute***
slider and using minutes

***Conditional questions***
if ED - was it because patient unwell, was it because no room in GTU, was it because of covid, was it patient likely for admission so to save multiple transfers
if A23 - was it reg only review or was it just because it was busy,  
theatre - emergency case that came in overnight, emergency case that wasn't done in the daytime
obstetric - review in ABC because SHO busy/patient acuity.
procedures - what was it - CS/repair/PPH/MROP/trial


*** Submit***
save to a data file somewhere.
